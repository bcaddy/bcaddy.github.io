## HLLD Prep

My first project this week was to get correct data from an HLLD solver. After
extracting the HLLD solver from Athena last week I ran some shock tubes using
Athena++, plotted the results to find the locations of the waves, then
extractracted the states on each side of each wave. After that I plugged those
states into the HLLD solver to get known correct fluxes. In addition to the
cross-wave states I only created some tests with special cases, negative
density, all zeros, degenerate state, etc.

Writing dozens of tests for the HLLD solver would have required duplicating a
ton of code. To deal with this I wrote a test fixture that handles most of the
actual running and testing so that the user just has to provide the states,
adiabatic index, etc. I tested it by implementing it the HLLC solver and made a
[PR with the new changes](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/pull/109).
While working on this I also implemented a processor agnostic function for
computing the MHD energy in a cell so I'll need to write some tests for that
too. I found that Athena does something so that their adiabatic index variable,
`Gamma`, appears to actually be \\( \gamma - 1 \\) but I haven't verified that.
I will look into that more next week and get it ironed out; I'll probably have
to rerun the flux calculations to get new fiducial fluxes.

## Other

- Figured out how to use VS Code for Jupyter Notebooks
- Ryu & Jones 1995[^rj] has a ton of great MHD shock tubes that would make
  fantastic system tests once MHD is done.
