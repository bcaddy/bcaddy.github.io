## HLLD Finalizing

I wrote some basic unit tests for the individual functions of the HLLD solver. I
think I hit all the edge cases but we'll find out if something fails later.
After that I cleaned up my git history and started thinking about next steps.

## Automated Testing

Jenkins is semi set up now on the CRC cluster. I was able to do some work on
that this week and met with the CRC to help them test it and discuss user needs.
Not a ton of progress on automated testing for Cholla yet but I'm making good
progress on learning how to work with Jenkins
