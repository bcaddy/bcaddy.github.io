## Cholla's Grid

I stared modifying [Cholla's](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla) grid to
accommodate magnetic fields. So far it's been reasonably straightforward but I
have a lot of questions I still need to figure out answers too. Sadly no plots
this week.

## Automated Testing

I believe the Jenkinsfile/pipeline is done, or at least mostly done, but I need
the Pitt CRC to hammer out some issues on their end before I can fully test it.
Once they've done that then I just need to setup GitHub integrations (also
reliant on CRC work) and automated testing will be done!
