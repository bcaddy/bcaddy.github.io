## Welcome!

You can download my IHPCSS Poster [here](/assets/pdf/IHPCSS-2022-Poster.pdf) or
viewed below.

If you've found your way here hopefully it's because you want to learn more
about me, my research, Cholla, or the details of implementing MHD simulations.
If you want to learn more about me and my research feel free to peruse the
various pages of this website linked in the sidebar or read through my research
blog. If you want to learn more about Cholla you can head over to the [GitHub
repo](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla) or the original [Cholla
paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0067-0049/217/2/24). If you're
interested in a break down of the algorithm I'm implenting for MHD in Cholla you
can check out my page on the [VL+CT Algorithm]({% post_url
2021-posts/2021-01-06-VL+CT-Algorithm%}) for the integrator or the [HLLD
Algorithm]({% post_url 2020-posts/2020-10-23-HLLD-Algorithm%}) for the MHD
Riemann Solver.
