## First Paper

The paper from my master's was published this week in Publications of the
Astronomical Society of the Pacific, Volume 134, Number 1039: [*Optical
Time-series Photometry of the Symbiotic Nova V1835
Aquilae*](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1538-3873/ac8f6f) by Caddy
et al 2022. It will appear on ArXiv next week.

## MHD Debugging

Debugging is still going. The debugger is helping but I've uncovered some issues
with the CUDA debugging flag `-G` leading to incorrect results in our
reductions. I'm discussing the issue with NVIDIA.

I did find a few other minor bugs.

## Other

- Wrote a LaTeX preamble for myself
- Read and presented on [Bailey et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08054)
- Read and wrote report on [Luhman 2012](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-astro-081811-125528)
