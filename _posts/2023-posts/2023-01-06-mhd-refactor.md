## MHD Refactor

This week has mostly been addressing issues raised in the code review of my MHD
PR. Mostly that was moving some functions out of Grid3D and into the MHD
namespace, adding comments, citing equations, etc.

## Other

- Jenkins should be ready on the Pitt cluster so I did some prep work for
  setting up that and will be meeting with that team shortly
- Watched HPC Best Practices talks 31, 68, and 69
