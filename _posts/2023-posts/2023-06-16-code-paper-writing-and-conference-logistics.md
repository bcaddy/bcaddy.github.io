The last two weeks have been a bit of a grab bag of random tasks but let's start with the biggest one.

## MHD Code Paper

In group meeting we discussed [Chamba et al. 2022](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12959) and [Knapen et al. 2023](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05503) which discuss how to write an astronomy paper. They were quite useful and I recommend them.

In terms of the paper itself, we finalized the outline and I finished the first draft of the methods section. I also made a first draft of the linear wave convergence plot and started on the shock tube plotting script.

## Conferences

I'm prepping to go to several convergences this year so I spent a big chunk of time working on logistics for those and preparing a talk abstract.

## Other

- add ORCID to website and update to v6.0.1
- Visited Goddard
