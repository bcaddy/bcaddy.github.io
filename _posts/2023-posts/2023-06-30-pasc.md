## Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing (PASC) Conference

I spent most of the week remotely attending PASC. It was really interesting and got me connected to the [US-RSE](https://us-rse.org) group.

## Optimize Characteristic Reconstruction

I refactored the characteristic reconstruction so that the eigenvectors are only computed once. This and Trey White's suggestion of adding `__launch_bounds__(256)` to a few kernel definitions improved performance by about 40%.

## Paper

I made the plots for the MHD Blast Wave and am mostly done with the Orszag-Tang Vortex plots.

## Other

- Profiled Cholla with HPCToolkit
- Opened a PR for the linear wave convergence test. [PR #305](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/pull/305)
