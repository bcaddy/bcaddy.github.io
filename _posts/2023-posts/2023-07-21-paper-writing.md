## Paper Writing

This week I mostly worked on rewriting and formalizing the methods section. It's still a work in progress but is getting much better.

## Miscellaneous

Lots of small random tasks this week so here's a breakdown:

- I start on code coverage generation. I've got it generally working but need to integrate it with Jenkins and Codecov
- Rebased PRs [#305](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/pull/305) and [#309](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/pull/309)
- Colloborated on Issues [#312](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/issues/312) and [#313](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/issues/313) including a partial fix for #313 in [PR #314](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/issues/314)
