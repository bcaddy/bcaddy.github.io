## PEARC23

I attended the [PEARC23](https://pearc.acm.org/pearc23/) conference. It was very interesting and I learned a lot from the various sessions. I got lots of networking done with various groups and was even able to attend the job fair. Overall it was a great experience.

## 1D Cholla Fixes

I collaborated with Alwin to fix some the issues that Cholla had running in 1D & 2D. See [PR #315](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/pull/315) and [PR #317](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/pull/317). As part of this I helped a student from another group get some of the examples running on Cholla.

## Paper Writing

I made another draft of the methods section with Evan's feedback and started another round of scaling tests so that I have data I can make plots with and write about. Hopefully those jobs will be done by Monday and I can make the last of the plots next week.
