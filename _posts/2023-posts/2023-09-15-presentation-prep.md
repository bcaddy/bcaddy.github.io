## JSI Workshop Presentation

I'm giving a talk at the [JSI Workshop](https://jsi.umd.edu/jsi-workshop-2023/) soon so I started working on that. I've got all the pieces done that don't require coding to generate plots. Of that plots that I need I have the Brio & Wu PLMC vs PPMC plot done. The repo with all the scripts for my talk is [here](https://github.com/bcaddy/JSI_Workshop_Talk_2023).

## MHD Slice Outputs

I needed to be able to output slice of MHD for one of the figures I want to make for the talk. I did this in [PR #334](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/pull/334).
