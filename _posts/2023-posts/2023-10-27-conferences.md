It's been awhile since I've updated here. Since my last update I had a significant surgery, went to [US-RSE'23](https://us-rse.org/usrse23/), and presented the [2023 JSI Workshop on Winds](https://jsi.umd.edu/jsi-workshop-2023/). So let's talk about what I did this week

## Conferences

I gave a talk at the 2023 JSI Workshop on Winds Across the Universe, you can find the talk [here](https://github.com/bcaddy/JSI_Workshop_Talk_2023). Overall it was a good conference and my talk was well received.

US-RSE'23 was very good. Lots of great info, talks, and job opportunities. It was awesome to be at the first RSE conference in the US.

## This Week

- Update resume and CV
- Gave a talk on scientific software best practices at Astrosnacks
- Updated some of the plots in my MHD paper
- Looked for high resolution MHD simulations. I didn't find anything even close the the resolution that we can run, in most cases we have higher resolution than even the highest effective AMR resolution
- Group hack session
  - [PR #350](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/pull/350) to consolodate and improve how we do GPU error checking. Along with [PR #322](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/pull/322) this resolves [Issue #286](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/issues/286) and [Issue #296](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/issues/296)
