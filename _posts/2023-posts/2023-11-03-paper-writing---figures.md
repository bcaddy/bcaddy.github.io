## Paper

This week I updated all the plots in the paper to be be better for publication rather than the first draft plots I had. I also did some editing so that I can focus on the second draft of the intro next.

## Code Work

The reviewer for [PR #347](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/pull/347) had some excellent comments on ways I could improve the code so I added them. That PR is now waiting for me to refactor the other concatenation scripts in a similar way which I will do when I have some time after the paper is done.

Reviewed [PR #353](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/pull/353) and [PR #354](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/pull/354).

## Talks

I'm giving talks soon at the University of Maryland and NASA Goddard so I spent some time prepping an updated and extended version of my [JSI talk](https://github.com/bcaddy/JSI_Workshop_Talk_2023). for that.
