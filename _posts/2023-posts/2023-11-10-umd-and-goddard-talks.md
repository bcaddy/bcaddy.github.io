## Paper

More work on the MHD methods paper. Most sections are done and the last few have solid second drafts. Hopefully mostly done.

## Talks

I was invited to give talks at the University of Maryland and NASA Goddard this week. Both talks went well and the slides can be found [here](https://github.com/bcaddy/JSI_Workshop_Talk_2023/tree/main).
