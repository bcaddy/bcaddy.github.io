## Job Search

Spent most of this week prepping for the two technical interviews for the Princeton RSE job.

## Hack Session

Started on [Issue #232](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/issues/232) which is partially addressed in [PR #359](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/pull/359). Still some bugs in it, the PPMC kernel is generating some weird results. Early performance gains are ~50-70% on a V100 which is great, hopefully we'll have even better improvements on the MI250X.
