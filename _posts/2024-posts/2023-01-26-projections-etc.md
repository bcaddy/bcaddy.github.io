This week was a mishmash of various smaller tasks so here's a quick summary

- Added a [wiki page for MHD](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/wiki/MHD)
- Organized a time for my defense
- Added MHD support to projection outputs (and fixed a few bugs) [PR #366](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/pull/366)
- Checked that the spherical collapse test is working and updated the [wiki page](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/wiki/3D-Spherical-Collapse)
