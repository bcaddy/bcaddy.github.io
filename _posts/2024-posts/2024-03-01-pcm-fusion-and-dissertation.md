## PCM/Riemann Solver Fusion

I finished fusing the PCM kernel with the Riemann solvers this week and posted a PR ([PR #377](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/pull/377)). Performance gain is just over 10% for MHD which is pretty much what I expected based on previous profiling.

## Dissertation

My committee wanted some revisions to my dissertation, mostly an extended intro, so I spent the rest of the week on that.
