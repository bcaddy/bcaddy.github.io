## PRs

I updated [PR #371](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/pull/371) with Matthew's suggestion for a better form of the `VectorXYZ` struct and updated [PR #391](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/pull/391) with a bunch of plots from testing the different reconstruction methods. Then I rebased all the PRs that are in flight so that they're up to date.

## PPM merge

I merged all three versions of PPM into one ([PR #392](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/pull/392)). It uses the new PPM version from Felker & Stone 2018; this also adds MHD support to PPM.

## Paper

We got the second reviewer report in, addressed the comments, and returned it. It's been accepted! I'll update the version on arXiv shortly.

## Graduation

This was my last week as a grad student. Thank you to everyone who wad involved during my time as a grad student, especially my advisor Evan Schneider for her exceptional advising.
